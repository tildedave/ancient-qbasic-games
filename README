I spent junior high/high school writing something like 30 QBasic games
that were of various themes -- mostly D&D Themed (Planescape,
Ravenloft) or D&D Inspired (from my own D&D campaigns).  Most of the
writing and plots are too cringe-worthy to upload (sorry :)), but I
ended up implementing some interesting code patterns to write the
games that I wanted.

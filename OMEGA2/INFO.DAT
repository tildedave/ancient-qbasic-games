   The Omega Blue Class 5 Robot was developed by Doctor Angela Brown of Omega
Blue in an effort to learn more about the histories of the five extinct
civilizations discovered by Omega Blue.  Only one prototype OBC5R was made,
as after the creation of the OBC5R, the first Omega Blue Class 6 Robots
were made, which had a greater capacity to understand and process
information.
  The Omega Blue Class 5 Robot had a highly advanced artificial intelligence
system, which allowed it to carry out the mission laid before it in an easy
fashion.  However, the OBC5R had a weak hull structure, which caused several
different malfunctions due to impacts at high speed and radiation.  The OBC5R
surpassed the OBC6R in only one way; it had the ability to think of itself as
a unique being, not just as a machine.

developed to fight in the Xao Rebellion of 2099, but the Rebellion and
resulting hostilities ended after only 50 of the robots were made.  The
robots carry highly focused laser beams, capable of disintegrating organic
molecules while leaving inorganic molecules unaffected.  It also was able
to be programmed as to specific mission instructions so that no loss of
life was needed to be risked.  The OBC1MR's laser beams were outlawed by the
United Nations Summit on Highly-Focused Laser Weapons, conducted in the
year 2165.  The ratification of this summit by the Nation of Europe suspended
all further production of the OBC1MR.

The United Nation's Summit on Highly-Focused Laser Weapons was held on

complained that the new weapon systems installed in the OBC1MR, developed
in Western Europe, were "against the basic principles and tenets of the
United Nations."  The Independent Republic of China cited previous
disarmament conferences, claiming that the weapons were too "prone to
abuse. "  The Summit focused on the fact that the OBC1MR's weapons systems "
incinerated living material, but left inorganic material unaffected.  The
Independent Republic of China also claimed that this was "comparable to a
hazardous biotoxin or chemical weapon."  In the end, the Summit was ratified
by all member nations except for the United States of North America, with
Representatives from the nations of Canada, the United States of America, and
Quebec opposing the weapons ban, saying that "the Omega Blue Class 1 Military
Robot's weapon system was used only as a detriment to war."  However, under
heavy economic pressure from the Independent Republic of China, all three
nations ratified it over the next few years:  Quebec in 2167, Canada in 2169,
and the United States in 2173.

Independent Republic of China

The Independent Republic of China is located in Central Asia, and is Earth's
main economic power, followed by Japan in second and the United States of
America in third.  The Independent Republic of China has had a long history,
and much controversy was caused in the late 20th century over Human Rights
abuses, which continued for over a course of more than one hundred years
before the Xao Rebellion of 2099 overthrew the ruling Communist Party.  Over
those one hundred years, an area in China known as Tibet had expressed the
desire to be free from Chinese rule.  With the Communist Party and all
centralized government abolished in China, Tibetan forces declared their
independence.  The result was a long, bloody struggle that divided Asia.
The new ruler of China, Shing Xaoteng, abolished the National People's
Congress, and ruled as dictator.  China's military forces fought a battle
on many fronts; one against the region of Tibet, another against the
nations of Mongolia, DPR Korea, and South Korea.  All three of those nations
saw the continuation of a communist government as an economic roadblock,
since after the year 2014, China's trade had begun to decline.  The
aquisition of Hong Kong from Great Britain in the summer of 1997 had proven
futile, as Human Rights became a bigger issue.  In 2012, the United Nations
held the International Summit on Human Rights in China.  Ratified by a
majority of member states, it imposed tariffs and other economic deterrants
to try to convince China to change it's human rights policy.
PAGE
After the Xao Rebellion was ended, a new government was put in place
consisting of one president, two vice presidents, and two different
Legislative Houses, the National People's Congress and the United Congress
of the Chinese People.  The military campaigns left all three warring
nations, Mongolia, DPR Korea, and South Korea, completely under Chinese
dominations.  However, the United Republic of Tibet had won its sovereignty
from China.  China did not see this as a great loss, and proclaimed itself
the Independent Republic of China.  As nations began to merge with each
other over the early and middle twenty-first century, China kept its
borders tight.  Now, China is again the number one economic power in the
world.  However, the Independent Republic of China is finding it hard to
advance into Outer Space, seeing as it has only two available spaceports,
both of them not very well funded.  Most of China's funds are allocated to
its military program.  It's recent robotics developments included the
IRCC3MR, a military robot that ecclipses all other robots in that field.

Xao Rebellion

The Xao Rebellion of 2099 was a violent uprising meant to overthrow the
current President of China, Li Deng Yu.  The Xao Rebellion was led by
the radical Shing Xaoteng, who took control of the country in Anarchy and
helped to fight back and dominate the attacking countries of Mongolia,
DPR Korea, and South Korea.  However, Shing Xaoteng was shot down by a
sniper on February 4, 2107.  The Chinese police later arrested a tourist,
Michael LeCarre, from the United States of America for Xaoteng's murder.
After the murder of Xaoteng, the popular military general Mao De Gu came to
power after his death, and created the current Chinese sytem of government.
On May 6, 2107, Mongolia was completely dominated by China.  DPR Korea met
its end on June 9, and South Korea was erradicated on June 28.  However,
the province of Tibet would not recognize Mao De Gu as leader of China, and
seceded from China.  After a lengthy military campaign (February 5, 2107 -
September 17, 2108) was unsuccessful, Mao De Gu grudgingly recognized the
international sovereignty of the United Republic of Tibet.  Thus did the
Xao Revolution end.

States in an effort to help their sinking economy since their disunion in the
early 21st century.  The United States of America allowed Quebec and Canada
to join the United States, adding Manitoba, Quebec, Ontario, the Northwest
Territories, the Yukon Territory, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia to the
United States.  However, the United States had to make a few concessions.
Firstly, all countries involved would retain a limited form of international
sovereignty, with legislation soley related to their respective countries
not being discussed in the new nation's political forum.  Also, the capital
of the New Nation would be moved to a more central location, the city of 
Madison, Wisconsin.  Since then, the USNA has become the number two economic

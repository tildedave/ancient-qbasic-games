keycard
Start
Designed into the circuitry of the OBC6R, the master key card
has the ability to scan a particular keycard slot and change the card's magnetic
field to match that of the slot.  The master key card will only work on keycard
slots.
STOP

laser
Start
Designed onto the right arm extension of the OBC6R, the hand
laser provides a channelled source of 5600 kJ of heat energy into the target.
This laser is not focused enough to kill humanoids, but it can kill living
tissue.  It also can provide a useful tool in the cases of locked doors.

device closed
Start
The device has on it an electronic display, and a keypad.
The most prominent thing about it is large red button on it.  The device
is made of an alien metal.  There is a small release near the back of the
device, apparently to open the device for maintenance.  However, the release
has a slot in it.  Sensors indicate the slot is not designed to fit an
electric keycard in.
STOP

device opened
Start
The device is opened.  Inside of the device, there is a large
amount of circuitry and wiring.  There is a lever on the left inside side of
the device.

socket in the device.
STOP

plaque untranslated
Start
The plaque seems to be composed of some sort of alien alloy.
Sensors are unable to detect any known elements within chemical structure
of plaque.  There are a few indecipherable etchings in the plaque's surface.
STOP

plaque translated
Start
The plaque seems to be composed of some sort of alien alloy.
Sensors are unable to detect any known elements within chemical structure
of plaque.  There is some writing on the plaque, translating to, "Security
System 5.4 in place.  Further travel to the south from here is impossible,
due to high-voltage lasers always remaining powered."
STOP

explosive unset
Start
The explosive contains four chambers within it.  Inside the
chambers are various radioactive elements, including traces of uranium and
plutonium.  Sensors report it to be a contained fission explosive.  Instead
of releasing a huge blast, as an atomic bomb would, it atomically vaporizes
any objects in contact with it when set off.  There is a timer on it, 
currently unlit.
STOP

keypad untranslated
Start
The keypad appears to be made up of ten distinct symbols on 
ten different keys, followed by four more keys that contain two symbols on 
each key.  At the bottom of the keypad is a red button.  To one side of the
keypad is an electrical socket.
